MONK's Problem 2 data set

1: Description.

The MONK's problems are a collection of three binary classification problems (MONK-1, MONK-2 and MONK-3) over a six-attribute discrete domain. Each problem involves learning a binary function defined over this domain, from a sample of training examples that belong to class 0 or class 1. 

This is the second problem of the collection, with no random noise added.
